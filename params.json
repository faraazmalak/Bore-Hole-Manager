The data is read from a text file and a visual map of bore holes is drawn (on a graphics window) for easy visualization","google":"","name":"Bore-hole-manager","body":"### Project Background\r\nBefore builders construct a large building, they must first sample the ground (soil) throughout the building site. They create “bore holes” by drilling down many meters and taking samples of the soil or whatever they find. They then know how to construct the foundations of the building (so that they rest on solid rock).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Project Goal\r\nThe aim is to create an application, which\r\n* Allows the user to perform CRUD operations on bore hole data\r\n* Draws the updated bore hole data on a graphics window for easy visualization \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Bore Hole Manager\r\nThis software solutions empowers the surveyors with a great way to analyze the bore hole data, when compared with the traditional method of preparing sheets of papers and referring to them. \r\n\r\nAfter surveying, the map of the bore holes needs to be drawn and plotted  on paper, to scale, which is a very tedious and time consuming process. This software allows the surveyors to overlook this tedious task.The software extracts and displays only the precise information the surveyor is looking for. It guides the surveyor with clear, easy to understand instructions.\r\n\r\nThe software can be copied on a pen drive / thumb drive and can be handed out to surveyors working on the project.The traditional methods require the surveyor to prepare numerous sheets containing survey data. Then, the sheets need to be photocopied and handed out to all the surveyors working on the project. This is both inefficient and time and labor consuming.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Main Features & Functionality\r\n1. The program calculates dimensions of survey area and creates an approximately large graphics window\r\n2. The graphics window will display the bore hole information as seen from (or projected to) the surface. Soil type and/or color and/or hardness are coded as different display colors (along with a legend)\r\n3. The user can choose to display soil strength, color and type at a selected depth. The information is displayed as concentric circles.\r\n4. The user can also perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on bore hole data"}
