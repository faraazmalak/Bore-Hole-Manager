{"tagline":"Application to Create, Read, Update, Delete Bore Hole Data. The data is read from a text file and a visual map of bore holes is drawn (on a graphics window) for easy visualization","body":"### Project Background\r\nBefore builders construct a large building, they must first sample the ground (soil) throughout the building site. They create “bore holes” by drilling down many meters and taking samples of the soil or whatever they find. They then know how to construct the foundations of the building (so that they rest on solid rock).\r\n\r\n### Project Goal\r\nTo create an application, which \r\n1. allows the user to perform CRUD operations on bore hole data\r\n2. Draws the updated bore hole data on a graphics window for easy visualization\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
